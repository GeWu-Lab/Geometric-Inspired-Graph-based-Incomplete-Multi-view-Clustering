# Geometric-Inspired Graph-based Incomplete Multi-view Clustering
<!-- A python implement for Geometric-Inspired Graph-based Incomplete Multi-view Clustering -->

Here is the official PyTorch implementation of GIGA proposed in ''Geometric-Inspired-Graph-based-Incomplete-Multi-view-Clustering'', which is a flexible weight allocation strategy to solve the view missing problem in multi-view clustering.


## Apporach Overview
GIGA addresses the problem of incomplete multi-view clustering. It takes into account the impact of missing views on the weight aggregation strategy which integrate knowledge from different views. Moreover, a geometric-inspired reallocation approach is introduced to mitigate this influence and attain a superior aggregation solution.
